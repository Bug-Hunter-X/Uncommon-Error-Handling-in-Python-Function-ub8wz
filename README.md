This repository contains a Python function demonstrating an uncommon error handling issue and its solution.  The function `function_with_uncommon_bug` aims to handle division by zero and invalid input types but fails to correctly handle strings that are implicitly convertible to numbers. The solution demonstrates how to handle these cases robustly using appropriate type checking and conversion.
